# Flask-Docker-Blueprint Template

This project can be used to run a basic flask app with Blueprint using docker-compose.

## Getting Started

**Step 1:** Make sure git is installed on your os. I will be using macOS for the project.

On macOS, you can install the git using Homebrew using ```brew install git```

**Step 2:** Clone the project into your local machine using below command.

```git clone https://github.com/KartikShrikantHegde/Photos-Docker-Blueprint```

### Prerequisites

**1. Docker**

Make sure you have Docker installed. Please follow the below link for official documentation from Docker to install latest version of docker on your os. For this project I am using Docker CE (18.09).

```https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/```

### Installing

**Step 1:** Change to the directory where the project was cloned in previous step.

```
cd Docker-Flask-Blueprint
```

**Step 2:** Make sure Docker is up and running. You can start the docker engine from desktop icon on Mac.

**Step 3:** Run

```
docker-compose up --build
```

**Step 4:** Open up the browser and paste the below url
